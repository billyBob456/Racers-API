# Racers-API

## About
Racers API is a game where you have to go around racing with your car, earning money. 
With that money you can buy cars and progress through the game!
You have to combine your coding skills and knowledge to start and finish. 
Making HTTP requests to the API and getting a response is what you need to learn.
You can play Racers API with any language that supports HTTP requests.
